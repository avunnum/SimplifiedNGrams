# SimplifiedNGrams

Developed a browser based tool to show the history of word usage in English text over time. Created a graph of all hypernyms and implemented a BFS algorithm to traverse the graph and output word relationships. 

I did this project while I was taking CS 61B: Data Structures and Algorithms.
